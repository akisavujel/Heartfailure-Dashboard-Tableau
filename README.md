# ❤️ Heart Failure Survival Analysis Dashboard (Tableau)

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project presents an interactive **Heart Failure Survival Analysis Dashboard** built using **Tableau**.  
The dashboard explores key clinical factors affecting patient survival and provides visual insights into mortality trends.

The analysis is based on a dataset of **299 patients**, focusing on medical attributes such as age, diabetes, smoking, serum creatinine, ejection fraction, and more.

## 📈 Key Metrics

- **Total Individuals:** 299  
- **Total Deaths:** 96  
- **Average Age:** 60.83 years  
- **Total Males:** 194  
- **Total Females:** 105  

## 🔎 Survival Analysis by Features

The dashboard analyzes survival trends based on:

- Anemia  
- High Blood Pressure  
- Smoking Status  
- Diabetes  
- Sex  
- Serum Creatinine  
- Serum Sodium  
- Ejection Fraction  
- Creatinine Phosphokinase  
- Platelets  
- Age  

## 📌 Key Insights

- Lower **ejection fraction** is associated with higher mortality.
- Higher **serum creatinine** levels correlate with increased death rates.
- Mortality appears slightly higher among **male patients**.
- Shorter follow-up time is strongly linked to death cases.
- Age plays a significant role in survival probability.
